### Project Description
OruKadhaSollatuma is an AR mobile game where players scan random real-world objects and receive wildly absurd, fantasy-style lore for them.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every day, thousands of rubber bands, broken pens, and used chewing gum wrappers are forgotten. Their stories are lost. Society ignores them. Our sidewalks are cemeteries of silent, heroic junk.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an AR game that lets users ‚Äúscan‚Äù these everyday objects and magically generates fantasy lore.
